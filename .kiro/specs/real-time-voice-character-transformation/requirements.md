# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a real-time voice transformation system that captures speech input, converts it to text, transforms the text to match a specific character's speaking style and personality, and then generates speech output using a matching voice model. The system is designed to run locally on high-end consumer hardware (RTX 4070 Super/RTX 5090) with minimal latency for near real-time performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to speak into my microphone and have my speech transformed into a character's voice in real-time, so that I can roleplay or entertain with different character personas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user speaks into their microphone THEN the system SHALL capture audio input with less than 100ms latency
2. WHEN audio is captured THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text using a local speech-to-text model
3. WHEN text is generated THEN the system SHALL transform the text to match the selected character's speaking style and vocabulary
4. WHEN character-styled text is ready THEN the system SHALL generate speech using a matching voice model
5. WHEN speech is generated THEN the system SHALL output audio through the default audio device
6. THE system SHALL complete the entire pipeline in under 2 seconds for typical utterances

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select from different character personas (anime waifu, patriotic American, slurring drunk, etc.), so that I can switch between different voice transformations based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a list of available character personas
2. WHEN the user selects a character persona THEN the system SHALL load the appropriate text transformation rules and voice model
3. WHEN a character is selected THEN the system SHALL persist the selection for future sessions
4. THE system SHALL support at least 3 distinct character personas initially
5. WHEN switching characters THEN the system SHALL update both text styling and voice output within 5 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to run entirely on my local machine without internet connectivity, so that I can maintain privacy and avoid dependency on external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL operate without requiring internet connectivity
2. WHEN processing audio THEN all speech-to-text conversion SHALL happen locally using GPU acceleration
3. WHEN transforming text THEN all character styling SHALL happen locally using a local language model
4. WHEN generating speech THEN all text-to-speech conversion SHALL happen locally using GPU acceleration
5. THE system SHALL utilize available GPU resources (RTX 4070 Super/RTX 5090) for optimal performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure audio input/output settings and adjust character transformation intensity, so that I can customize the system to my hardware and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL display available audio input devices
2. WHEN the user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL display available audio output devices
3. WHEN the user adjusts transformation intensity THEN the system SHALL modify how strongly character traits are applied to text
4. WHEN settings are changed THEN the system SHALL save configuration persistently
5. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load previously saved settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback showing the processing pipeline status, so that I can understand what the system is doing and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is being captured THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator of microphone input levels
2. WHEN speech-to-text is processing THEN the system SHALL show the recognized text in real-time
3. WHEN text transformation is occurring THEN the system SHALL display both original and character-styled text
4. WHEN text-to-speech is generating THEN the system SHALL show generation progress
5. IF any pipeline stage fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested solutions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system architecture to be modular and extensible, so that I can easily add new character personas and voice models in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new character THEN the system SHALL support loading character definitions from configuration files
2. WHEN adding a new voice model THEN the system SHALL support pluggable voice model interfaces
3. WHEN modifying character behavior THEN changes SHALL not require code modifications to core pipeline logic
4. THE system SHALL separate concerns between audio processing, text transformation, and speech generation
5. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing character definitions
